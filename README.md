# MIVAA Bronze Zone Tool

This repository contains a robust software utility designed to validate and process field boundaries data in CSV format. Built with a focus on ensuring data quality, the utility plays a critical role in preparing high-quality data for ingestion into platforms like OSDU, adhering to the principles of the Medallion Architecture. Currently, this utility implements only bronze zone validations.

## Steps to Run the Application Using the Startup Script

### 1. Setup the Environment

#### For Windows:
1. Open Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to the repository directory and run:
   ```cmd
   startup-windows.bat D:/MIVAA-ai/mivaa-bronze-directory
   ```
   Replace `D:/MIVAA-ai/mivaa-bronze-directory` with your desired base directory.

#### For Linux:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Make the script executable (only needed the first time):
   ```bash
   chmod +x startup-linux.sh
   ```
4. Run the command:
   ```bash
   ./startup-linux.sh /path/to/mivaa-bronze-directory
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mivaa-bronze-directory` with your desired base directory.

### 2. Initialize the Database

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python startup.py
```
This will initialize the database and prepare the application for use. Example log output:
```plaintext
INFO - Initialize the database from the JSON Schema file.
INFO - Database initialization completed successfully.
INFO - Starting application...
```

### 3. Start the Application Using Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the application:
```bash
docker-compose --env-file .env up --build
```

### Error Logging
Errors are logged in the database with severity levels (`WARNING`, `ERROR`). Detailed logs are generated to help users identify and resolve issues efficiently.

## Accessing Logs and Outputs

- **Uploads Directory**:
  Place your CSV files in the directory specified in the `UPLOADS_DIR` path in your `.env` file.
- **Processed Directory**:
  The validated and processed files will be saved in the directory specified in the `OUTPUT_DIR` path.
- **Error Logs**:
  Detailed error logs are saved in the database and corresponding output folders for review.

## Troubleshooting

- **Check Environment Variables**:
  Ensure the directories specified in the `.env` file exist and are accessible.
- **Inspect Docker Logs**:
  Run the following command to view Docker logs:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```
- **Rebuild Containers**:
  If you encounter issues, rebuild the containers using:
  ```bash
  docker-compose --env-file .env up --build
  ```
